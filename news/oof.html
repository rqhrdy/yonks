Now some are calling for an investigation</a></span></div></div></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">For the Phase 3 study, researchers plan to enroll 30,000 adult participants, including people whose locations or circumstances put them at high-risk of infection. One group will be injected with 100 micrograms of the vaccine on day 1 and again on day 29. A second group will be injected with two doses of a placebo for comparison.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Fourteen days after the participants get their second dose, the researchers will be looking at whether they develop Covid-19. The participants will be followed for two years after receiving their second dose.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The study will be conducted at 87 locations across the United States.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Moderna's vaccine candidate is one of 23 in clinical trials around the world, according to the World Health Organization. </div><div class="el__leafmedia el__leafmedia--factbox el__leafmedia--standard"><div class="el__storyelement--standard"><div class="el__storyheader el__factbox--title">Get CNN Health&#39;s weekly newsletter </div><div class="el__storycontent el__storycontent--standard"><p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/cnn/resultsarein" target="_blank">Sign up here to get <strong>The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</strong></a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.</p></div></div></div><div class="ad ad--epic ad--mobile" data-ad-text="show"><div data-ad-id="ad_rect_btf_01" data-ad-position="mobile" data-ad-refresh="default"></div></div><ul class="cn cn-list-hierarchical-xs cn--idx-50 cn-zoneAdContainer" data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Overall, "the safety and immunogenicity data in this preliminary report are promising, and they support continued development of this vaccine. However, we must bear in mind the complexity of vaccine development and the work still to be done before Covid-19 vaccines are widely available," Dr. Penny Heaton, chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, wrote in an editorial accompanying the Phase 1 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Accelerating the development of Covid-19 vaccine candidates beyond phase 1 depends on continued parallel tracking of activities and fulsome resources. The world has now witnessed the compression of 6 years of work into 6 months," Heaton wrote. "Can the vaccine multiverse do it again, leading to a reality of a safe, efficacious Covid-19 vaccine for the most vulnerable in the next 6?"</div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph
